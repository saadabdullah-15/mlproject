# Machine Learning Project

## Overview
This project is a machine learning pipeline designed to train and deploy models for predicting student performance. It includes tools for data ingestion, preprocessing, model training, and deployment through a web interface.

## Features
- Data ingestion from CSV files.
- Data preprocessing using scalable transformation pipelines.
- Model training with CatBoost and other algorithms.
- Deployment using a web application.
- Logging and exception handling for robust operations.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd mlproject-main
   ```

2. Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
### Running the Web Application
1. Start the application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
2. Open your browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

### Training the Model
1. Edit `src/pipeline/train_pipeline.py` to configure training parameters.
2. Run the training script:
   ```bash
   python src/pipeline/train_pipeline.py
   ```

### Making Predictions
1. Use `src/pipeline/predict_pipeline.py` for batch predictions.
2. Run the prediction script:
   ```bash
   python src/pipeline/predict_pipeline.py
   ```
